# My health story

I have been on a pretty long and crazy health journey, and now that I've figured out a lot of important things and
recovered in big ways, I thought I would write about it. I want this page to be a one-stop place for people who may have
zero history of my past as well as those who have followed along at different points but are trying to connect the dots
or learn about my current condition. Spoiler alert, my current condition is about 99% better than it was at its worst,
and I'm back to rock climbing, guitar, fire spinning, and using my arms for whatever I feel like. Thanks Nichole Sachs!

## Ow

In May of 2020, while typing for work, I suddenly experienced excruciating pain in both of my forearms. It was so
painful, so immediate, and so obviously wrong, that I had to stop working immediately and go on medical leave and
disability.

I was diagnosed with many things over the years. Carpal tunnel syndrome (never had it), cubital tunnel syndrome (never
had it), thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) (probably had it), and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) (probably had it).
There were more, but these are maybe the biggest ones.

I'm going to condense a LOT of information for now, and just say that for most of May 2020 to April 2025, I believed
that I suffered primarily from thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). I still think that was the primary culprit, but there was
an emotional dimension to my chronic pain which by the end of that period accounted for the majority of my pain - but
way more on that later.

Specifically, following an MRI I was told that I had bilateral (both sides) neurogenic (affecting nerves) and venous
(affecting the blood veins) thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). Essentially, in TOS, the bundle of nerves and blood vessels
that feed into your arm are compressed by the first rib which causes pain and other problems. As a result of the MRI and
the severity of its findings, it was recommended that I undergo surgery.

The surgery is called a first rib resection (FRRS) in which they remove your first (topmost) rib. This involves
disconnecting several muscles in the neck (scalenes, accessory breathing muscles) as well. They also snipped the pec
minor muscle since that can contribute to compression in that area. The surgery is a huge one because of its proximity
to the lungs and nerves. Much can go wrong. They don't do two sides at once, so I did it once on the left side in June
2021 and again on the right side in October 2021.

The left side surgery went really well. In the hours, days, and months following that surgery I said things like "I
can't complain". It felt surprisingly the same once my shoulder unstiffened from being immobilized for a little while.

The right side surgery went exceptionally poorly. In hindsight, this is when I may have gotten complex regional pain
syndrome (CRPS). For over a month, my right arm was inflated with fluid (edema). I couldn't remotely close my first. I
was in agony a lot of the time. If my right arm touched anything, it hurt, so I sought to find positions in which I
could hang my arm and have it contact as little as possible. There are many stories from this period, but I can
summarize them by saying: "ow".

Maybe 3-6 months later, the worst of those symptoms had begun to subside, and I was left in a place very similar to
where I started: if I attempted to use my arms for anything substantial, they would flare up and be in consistent pain
for about 2 weeks or so until they calmed back down.

## Ugh

Following those surgeries, I was told that it could take up to 2 years to get back to a good place. Of course I was told
other things too, like my surgeon telling me I'd be climbing within a year. Yeah, that didn't happen.

I would characterise the period after the surgeries, let's say January 2022 to April 2025 as somewhat samey. There were
plenty of ups and downs in actuality. I even returned to work, doing my software development work entirely by voice, but
then experienced a huge set of flareups and wave of new symptoms in November 2023 that put me firmly back on disability.

Still, I can lump this large ~3 year span of time into a relative plateau of not being physically or mentally healthy,
but doing my best to get on with life in ways I could, and try to make peace with the fact that I would never climb,
play guitar, fire spin, etc again.

## Whaaa??

Finally, I read the book that changed everything for me, to my continual astonishment. After seeing my neurologist
again, she recommended a new book: Mind your Body by Nichole Sachs. She said that the mind-body approach outlined in the
book was helping a lot of people cure their chronic pain.

Maybe your hippy-dippy/wuwu alarm is going off. That was me, but I'm glad: 1. that I was at such a desperate place that
it was easy to ignore, and 2. that Nichole Sachs is sooo good at making the argument that mind body conditions are very
real.

The eventual, incredible and very tangible changes in my body have ended up being my irrefutable proof that this stuff
is real.

So what are we talking about? Well, in my own words let me try to teach you what I learned.

## Mind-body

You know when you have to make a speech, and you get butterflies in your stomach? Maybe you get a little nauseous?

Or how about when you're so stressed that you get a headache, or wake up covered in hives (this happened to me!).

Or maybe you've got more personal examples of emotions leading to acute conditions in your body. Maybe it's that your
brain tends to shut off and make you really tired when you're in a social situation you wish you weren't in. Bed time I
guess! But then you get in bed and feel pretty dang awake...

The pattern here is that we all can relate with the concept that your emotional state can lead to bodily symptoms in
these short term examples. This is the "acute" part. So why then is such a foreign and unbelievable concept that
distressed emotional states could lead to chronic physical symptoms?

This is what happened to me: a chronic state of emotional distress led to the chronic manifestation of physical
symptoms.

It's happened to many people it turns out, and if you just for fun take the above statement as true, it can connect a
lot of dots. There have been so many stories of people experiencing miraculous cures from dubious methods. But if what
underlies those methods is some kind of process that affects the patient emotionally, then that change can lead to
healing.

Think of all of those conditions which list as a risk factor "stress", and how a doctor says to reduce stress in order
to help ease a symptom.

To me, western medicine just hasn't quite caught up to the power of mind body medicine because of the very real
difficulties in measuring results in an objective way. When we're talking about emotions and pain levels, these things
are notoriously difficult to quantify, and so drawing conclusive results is hampered.

But anecdotally, there are a LOT of people who are curing health problems with the mind-body approach (which I'll
describe shortly): people have cured their nerve pain, chronic fatigue syndrome, psoriasis, cyclical vomiting... the
list is long. But maybe it doesn't seem likely that these conditions could have been caused ultimately by emotions?
Reasonable, and I do think these conditions are real and sometimes structural, where a mind-body approach won't
completely resolve them. But at the same time, think about the acute conditions I described at the beginning of this
section and compare to these more chronic versions of those symptoms. Wouldn't it be reasonable to believe that there is
a chronic analogue to those acute conditions, when the emotional problem is itself a long lived and chronic thing too?

### How it works

The book Mind your Body by Nicole Sachs describes this disregulated nervous system condition as tension myoneural
syndrome (TMS), but the name of the condition isn't important. Let's just start with a few key terms defined in a
reductive way here:

1. Nervous system. The entity inside you that is responsible for keeping you safe
2. Emotional reservoir. An internal reservoir which holds negative feelings, such as dread, despair, grief, terror,
   rage, shame, etc.

Let's talk about the emotional reservoir. This is where one stuffs their feelings. It fits an intuitive model that we
reference when we say stuff like "he bottles up his emotions" or "she needs to let off some steam". It's the idea that
your negative emotions build up in some kind of container inside of you, and need release.

I grew up always bottling my negative emotions. At some point I learned that showing these emotions was strictly bad. By
voicing anger or fear, I thought I was just inviting more of that emotion into existence. So I rarely voiced my fears,
anger, sadness, etc, except when it became too much to contain, and then it spilled out in uncontrolled waves. Not the
best way to go about life.

Nicole Sachs describes what happens when you fill up your emotional reservoir as follows. Eventually, you have so much
negative emotion bottled up that you can't really get away from it. Let's say you've got this sense of despair about the
state of politics. Well, any number of news headlines or friends' off-handed mentioning of some political event would
direct your mind, at least in some small and subconscious way, back to the bottled up despair. So a seemingly innocuous
comment by a loved one about the news might trigger feelings of despair.

When this happens often enough, your nervous system (the other entity defined above) takes notice. It says "hey, when
you think about this stuff, you feel BAD. this stuff is dangerous." And what does the nervous system do to communicate
danger? It can do lots of things, but primarily it delivers pain.

Think about how any cut simply hurts to alert you to the danger that wound represents. Or how getting your hand too
close to a stove similarly is a signal from the nervous system, saying "this is dangerous! please stay away from the
danger. thank you.".

This is the essential mechanism that a chronically full emotional reservoir triggers. It can trigger your nervous system
to send pain signals (or maybe its fatigue signals as in chronic fatigue syndrome, etc) upon experiencing those negative
emotions too often.

### Learned pain

Now, when you feel chronic pain, something additional happens. Neurologists will say "nerves that fire together, wire
together" to describe the phenomenon of neuroplasticity. What this is saying is, when things happen to occur together,
our brains and neural tissue has this habit of wiring those things together. When it happens a lot, there are lots of
opportunities to wire those things together really well. You're neurons are literally learning the pain. This has a
name: neuroplastic pain.

The crazy thing is that this pain is exactly as real as normal, structural pain. In both cases, the pain signals end up
in the same place in your central nervous system (brain), giving the same message. Nicole says "the pain is not in your
head, but the solution is not in your body". To be honest, I find this statement very difficult to reason about.

If someone asked me, "so it was all in your head?" I might reply "Yeah, because ALL pain is in your head". And then I'd
probably argue my point with lots more words and examples of lived experience.

One thing I like to share is how utterly astounding it can be to learn how deeply pain can be learned. You may imagine
my experience in my head as like:

"Geez I'm uncomfortable. Oh, was that a little tickle on my arm? Oh is my arm in pain? Omg I think my arm hurts. It
totally hurts. My arm is on FIRE."

Like, somehow convincing myself on a concious level through some anxiety-led stream of consciousness thought process
that I'm in pain. This is NOT how it works. At all. It's wayyy deeper and more astounding than any of that.

Instead, imagine you're Ben who is very tired. Deeply tired. All you want to do is sleep. You are in bed, and
comfortable, in no pain at the moment. It feels so right not to be moving, in that way where every part of your body and
mind seem to completely agree that: it is now time to sleep. It is one of those nights where it will be very easy to
fall asleep, it'll take mere seconds. Sleep comes on slowly, and you experience the mind drifting sensation as parts of
your conscious mind shut down.

BAM. You're awake. Why are you awake? Because your arms are experiencing bursts of lancing pain, elbow to pinky. Whyy?
You were so completely comfortable and you didn't move an inch. You're still dead tired, but now you gotta deal with
this and reposition your body to ease the symptoms somehow.

This happened to me many times. I tell it as a way to illustrate how deeply the pain is learned. I'm of the firm opinion
that in these moments, I wasn't experiencing any pain related to a structural problem. Instead, perhaps some dream
thought formulated that triggered my nervous system into thinking: DANGER. And then the pain comes, because the "fire
together, wire together" process has connected mental danger to physical pain.

So rather than it being a conscious-mind controlled thing, it is this deep part of you capable of turning on the pain.
It's wild. As wild as it is to fully realize that, it's equally wild to experience how very real methods can be employed
to unlearn these connections. You can unlearn the pain that has been connected to your emotions. It still astounds me in
how visceral and real it is. In my experience, it sometimes feels like my nervous system is this independent machine
that runs inside of me. I can do very specific things for it such as going through certain physical actions or mental
exercises and somehow these exercises will reconfigure this magical machine inside of me to work better. And it does
work better - reliably, consistently, and demonstrably so. The changes are so tangible, they are impossible to ignore.

So I really recommend being kind to your nervous system and taking care of it. And how should you do that you ask?

### Journalspeak + Meditation

Nicole Sachs describes in her book the process of journalspeak, and I really recommend using that as a source. I expect
that if you've read this far, there will be a temptation to take my description of the method of journalspeak and just
go for it. The problem is, the prework is really necessary. Nicole spends the first many chapters of the book preparing
you in so many ways so that you are correctly primed. So that you actually believe that the process will help. She does
an amazing job of convincing even the most skeptical that this process can work; it worked on me! So know that what I
say here is the tip of the iceberg basically.

The goal is to, every day, journal for 20 minutes in a very particular way, followed by meditating for 10 minutes in any
way you like. The journaling should be done in a completely safe space where you feel free to feel. You can write or do
speech to text like I do. When you start out, you want to do the prework of creating lists that can help guide your
journaling topics. After you get some fluency in journalspeak, it can be more stream of consciousness.

You write down for 20 minutes exactly how you feel about whatever thing. You don't hold back.

"I'm so fucking tired of being alive. Every day is the fucking same thing. Can it fucking end already?"

Cursing? Great, as long as it feels like you. You CANNOT be politically correct, or pull any punches. You're getting all
the rage, shame, grief, despair, etc out. It hasn't had a voice until now, and the whole exercise is to get it out.
Drain that emotional reservoir. You'll write things that feel good to write, but aren't true. You'll end up saying
something that feels wayyy too harsh but you realize it's how you really felt. Whether it's true or not doesn't always
matter, but how true it FEELS does matter.

It's easy to just waste time not being honest with yourself. But the spirit of the exercise is to finally be real and
say the thing that felt unforgivable or too terrifying to say or think until now. Air those negative emotions, and to
teach your nervous system that in fact, the terror, despair, etc associated with certain thoughts doesn't have to exist.
You can think of those things, experience the negative emotions they bring on, and when those emotions pass, those
subjects that haunted you internally for so long aren't nearly as scary as they once were.

Here's an important part: after 20 minutes, you destroy the entry. It was never meant for future you or anyone else to
read. By some stroke of luck, it turns out that getting these things out once, in any manner, even if you're not
communicating those things to another human, is sufficient for retraining your nervous system. You're finding those
parts of your thoughts and mind that are the scariest, most trauma-ridden, most rage-filled corners and shining a light
for a brief moment, and then walking away.

Naturally, you'll calm down and some really big revelations may present themselves. Or not. In the end, it's a nervous
system retraining exercise in which you surface all of those buried feelings and empty that reservoir.

After all that, you may not be ready to say, jump into a work call. That's why there's 10 minutes of meditaiton. The
meditation is likely doing other things for you too. Especially if you do recurring loving-kindness meditation exercies
as Nicole suggests, but she also says it doesn't matter. Just breath in 5 seconds, out 5 seconds and try to focus on
your breath. Or do a guided meditation. Anything works. You'll feel better afterwards.

So that's it - 30 minutes a day, and you can substantially change your perspective on many things about your life. You
can make alarming or heartwarming discoveries about yourself and your relationships. You can literally heal and cure
those physical symptoms that have so long ailed you. It's astounding to me that it works. And it really does.

## In Conclusion

It was my neurologist, a very mainstream, respected doctor in San Francisco, Dr. Liberty Jenkins, who recommended this
book to me. I think that western medicine is catching up to the power of this kind of mind-body work, and it's about
time.

It was immediately that I started feeling better. The pain was 50% better within a week, and then it got to maybe 80%
several weeks later. 3 months later, I'd say I'm 99% better. Whereas it hurt to type, stand, walk, sit, and simply exist
before, I can climb, run, and wiggle my arms rhythmically if I feel like it. That transformation over such a short time
period and deeply connecting with how my body and mind function all amounted to a minor spiritual experience but I won't
get into that here. I'm still figuring it out, really, but I'm finally listening and understanding what my body needs,
and I've never felt better about my life.

I still have lingering symptoms: my arms go numb when holding on to a vibrating electric razor or a blender for
instance, and if I get anxious my arms can go numb. For these reasons and others, I'm convinced I did have some amount
of structural issues with my nerves. But certainly by April 2025 when I discovered mind-body medicine, my condition was
mostly an emotional one. After just 3 months and so much positive change, I have no doubt that I'll continue to unlearn
those neuroplastic things that can be unlearned, and the rest I'll happily deal with.

If you helped me during my years of extreme disability, I'm more grateful than I can ever express. Given how desperately
low the lows got, you may just have saved my life by being that compassionate support network I needed.

Thanks for reading my rambling saga. Now go forth, be kind to your nervous system, and talk about these ideas with those
you know. Let's make this stuff common knowledge to prevent needless suffering!
