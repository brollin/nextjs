# Sandbox

3D sandbox environment for playing with ThreeJS concepts.

## Ideas

- reflective objects with cool environment maps, lesson 12
- move particles through flow fields, elongate cylinders along path
- morph from one object to another
- play with toonmaterials for cartoon feel
- play with displacement maps to make 3d surfaces out of textures
